FiveR/Loader Project Summary
===========================

Timeline & Context
------------------
* Project: Roblox hub with Loader.lua + game modules (Arsenal, PrisonLife, FiveR).
* Focus (23–24 Oct): integrate FiveR, match UI, stay stealthy vs Adonis/Alpine anticheat.
* Recurrent warning: 'Could not compile FiveR script' when loader receives malformed or empty FiveR.lua.

Current Status
--------------
* Working files: Loader.lua, Games/FiveR.lua, Games/PrisonLife.lua, Games/Arsenal.lua, Games/BloxFruits.lua, uitleg.txt.
* Working dir: c:\\Users\\Arda\\Desktop\\data
* Editor tabs usually open: Loader.lua, Games/FiveR.lua, Games/PrisonLife.lua, Games/Arsenal.lua, Games/BloxFruits.lua, uitleg.txt.

Loader.lua Highlights
---------------------
* Uses fetchService helper; fetchRemote first tries syn/http/request with salted URL + slight delay, then falls back to game:HttpGet on failure.
* Key system + selector UI (Arsenal, Prison Life, FiveR).
* FiveR window contains Utility, ESP, Movement, Misc tabs (Teleports removed).
* Utility tab toggles: Auto Interact, Auto Collect, Dispatch Notifications, 'Politie waarschuwing', Alert Range slider.
* Movement tab: Walk Speed, Sprint, Jump toggles + stealth flight speed (10–120).
* Misc tab: Night Vision, Clear Weather, Reset Visuals.
* Loader logs warning if FiveR fails to compile and avoids VirtualUser or disallowed services.

Games/FiveR.lua Highlights
---------------------------
* Services: Players, RunService, UserInputService, TweenService, Lighting, StarterGui, etc.
* Utility features: auto prompts, auto drop collection, dispatch alerts, optional police proximity alerts (CheckPoliceProximity uses isPoliceTeam).
* ESP: player/vehicle highlights respect MaxDistance slider and toggle states, disabling instantly when off.
* Movement: walk/sprint/jump modifiers plus lerp-based stealth flight that honors slider speed and clamps altitude without BodyVelocity.
* Anti-AFK: jump nudge instead of VirtualUser.
* Misc: night vision, clear weather, reset visuals; teleports fully removed (no CaptureLocation/SetPreset).

Fixes & Lessons
----------------
1. Script corruption (e.g., stray 'endfunction', 'function Fix') broke compilation. Always revert to clean remote copy before tweaks.
2. Missing HTTP fallback caused fetchRemote to return nil. Added safeHttpGet fallback with salted query.
3. Loader Teleports tab removed for FiveR to prevent references to deleted functions.
4. Stealth tweaks kept: lerp flight, police alerts optional, no BodyVelocity/VirtualUser usage.

Testing Checklist
-----------------
1. Execute loadstring: loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ardinoshopz2-ship-it/7/main/Loader.lua'))().
2. Pass key system, select FiveR card; no console warning should appear.
3. Verify Utility defaults (AlertPolice=false, AlertRange=150).
4. Toggle ESP/vehicles and adjust MaxDistance to confirm live updates.
5. Test movement toggles and flight speed (ensure no anticheat kick).
6. Toggle night vision / clear weather and use Reset Visuals.

Troubleshooting
----------------
* If warning returns, inspect Games/FiveR.lua from top for stray code; compare with remote if needed.
* Search for 'endfunction', duplicate function definitions, or leftover teleport code.
* Confirm loader's fetchRemote still includes safeHttpGet fallback and executor allows HTTP.
* Manually run game:HttpGet on FiveR.lua in executor to verify network access.
* Some executors require enabling HttpService; check documentation.

Pending Ideas
-------------
* Fine-tune flight altitude clamp if Alpine still flags usage.
* Optional QoL: throttle police alerts, add user whitelist, or reintroduce teleports once reliable coordinates exist.
* Keep this summary updated when new changes occur.

Recent Timeline
---------------
* 23-10 evening: initial FiveR integration (with teleport UI) worked; later refactors removed teleports for stability.
* 24-10 15:05 NL: confirmed working after reapplying stealth flight + police alerts; issue recurred when file merges corrupted syntax.
* Loader fallback fix deployed 24-10 to handle executors without syn.request.

Hand-off Reminder
-----------------
* Latest files in this workspace (Loader.lua & Games/FiveR.lua) contain all fixes as of 24-10 15:30 NL.
* Refer to this summary before modifying FiveR to avoid reintroducing compile errors.
